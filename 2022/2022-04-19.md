### You get a huge file locally

You can use dblog instead of logging to a file by doing this:

- Enable dblog (if not enabled with config split)
- Add this to settings.local.php (if not already there):

```php
$settings['container_yamls'][] = DRUPAL_ROOT . '/sites/default/services.local.yml';
```

Then create (or update) a file called '`sites/default/services.local.yml` with this content:

```
parameters:
  # Enable dblog as logger. Requires dblog module to be active.
  monolog.channel_handlers:
    default:
      - drupal.dblog
````
