## Questions / Comments

### Who has access to tugboat and to build a PR?

Currently only invited people. So you might have to ask to get a PR environment

### How can you inspect the logs from a tugboat deployment

Currently only available in tugboat, so it would be the same people who has access to the tugboat dashboard.

### How can I test (for example) how indexing a single product works?

Currently not something we have a solution for. You would have to create the product manually, at least until we can actually use a more similar database to the live environment where we would actually also have products.
