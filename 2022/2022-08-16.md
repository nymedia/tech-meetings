## Questions / Comments

### How are we assigning upgrades, who does what?

It depends. Some projects are more unique and would need an individual plan. Some projects should be able to follow a recipe. This recipe should be possible to follow for more than a handful of people, so it would be more effective and more people can upgrade sites.

### Are there any modules that are unsupported that we use?

Not entirely. There is one module we use where we use an old version branch (elasticsearch_helper 5.x), but it's easy to use with drupal 9. No such cases has been encountered as of now.

### What platform should we use to document how to upgrade?

We will get back to it. But a goal towards having effective communication would be to have the documentation open (publicly accessible).
