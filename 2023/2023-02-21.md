## Questions / Comments

- You can also reference modules in a project by requiring the dev branch, but using version is always better even if the module is in an unstable version
- It's a good idea to avoid slashes in branch names since it might introduce problems in the future if someone is making a branch with the name of the prefix before the slash. We have yet to decide upon a pattern for feature branches, so this is very much up for discussion
